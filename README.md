## Pansatori GmbH and Tinnitus Treatment
pansatori GmbH is a startup-business located in upper Austria. The company is dedicated to help people suffering from tinnitus.
For that, we developed an acupressure-stimulating medical device called "ForgTin"; additionally, customers may use an accompanying app to keep track
of changes in their tinnitus loudness.
This GitHub project serves to publish small code snippets (not full analyses!) on simulated data.
Currently, this includes a standard linear (descriptive) trend and a saturating exponential curve.
